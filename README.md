## About Project

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dash. In this project, we are going to build a ruby app that decodes the mose code automatically.



## Built With

* Ruby


## Getting Started

* Clone this repo <https://github.com/white3d/Ruby-Decode-Mose-Code.git>

    git clone https://github.com/white3d/Ruby-Decode-Mose-Code.git
    ```

* Navigate to SpaceTravelers folder/directory

    ```bash
    cd Ruby-Decode-Mose-Code
    ```
